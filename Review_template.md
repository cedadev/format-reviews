# Producers can make the files on most platforms with available tools.
> Who are the foreseen creators that would produce data in this format?  
> What are the foreseen feature types for the data?  
> What are their preferred computing platforms and tools for this community?  
> Are there existing tools to create files in this environment?  
> If not can they create the files with other tools available to them?  


# format should be platform neutral.
R2A: Do the files have a big-endian, little-endian options?
R2B : If text files, are files in a specified character set?
R2C: Is common software for reading the data available on common platfo

# Required file level metadata can be encoded.
R3A :What metadata standards are used by the user community?
R3B : What are the requirements for file level metadata for ingest and use?
R3C : Are all of these metadata elements encodable into the format?
R3D : Are there established conventions for encoding the metadata into the format?

# Format compliance can be checked.
R4 A: Are there tools to check file format compliance?
R4 B: Are there tools to check metadata conventions compliance?
R4 C: Is it feasible to develop checking tools?

# Format should be stable (changes are managed).
R5A: Are changes to the format managed?
R5A: Historically what is the frequency of changes to the format?
R5A: Have changes been backwards compatible?
R5A: Have tools to read old version been preserved?

# Format should be open (if not one has any software to read the data, user can write there own).
R6A: Are there public domain document describing the format?
R6B: Are the documents sufficient to engineer software to read data in the file format?
R6C: How much effort would it be to engineer read software from scratch?

# Format should be migratable (as improved formats appear the significant properties of the files can be transferred to new formats).
R7A: Are there any format specific encodings that would be hard to move to other formats. (e.g. coloured cells in excel)

# Format is in use by the data centre user community
R8A: What is the designated user community for this feature type and use metadata?
