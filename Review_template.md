# Reveiw details

> Reviewers compiling report *  
> When was it complied?  
> CEDA contact (if reviewer is external)  

# Format details
> Title of the format *  
> short name  
> file suffix (if any)  
> Links to documentation/community pages  
> General format type 


# Producers can make the files on most platforms with available tools.
> Questions to consider:
>  - Who are the foreseen creators that would produce data in this format?  
>  - What are the foreseen feature types for the data?  
>  - What are their preferred computing platforms and tools for this community?  
>  - Are there existing tools to create files in this environment?  
>  - If not can they create the files with other tools available to them?  


# format should be platform neutral.
> Questions to consider:
>  - Do the files have a big-endian, little-endian options?
>  - If text files, are files in a specified character set?
>  - Is common software for reading the data available on common platforms

# Required file level metadata can be encoded.
> Questions to consider:
>  - What metadata standards are used by the user community?
>  - What are the requirements for file level metadata for ingest and use?
>  - Are all of these metadata elements encodable into the format?
>  - Are there established conventions for encoding the metadata into the format?

# Format compliance can be checked.
> Questions to consider:
>  - Are there tools to check file format compliance?
>  - Are there tools to check metadata conventions compliance?
>  - Is it feasible to develop checking tools?

# Format should be stable (changes are managed).
> Questions to consider:
>  - Are changes to the format managed?
>  - Historically what is the frequency of changes to the format?
>  - Have changes been backwards compatible?
>  - Have tools to read old version been preserved?

# Format should be open (if not one has any software to read the data, user can write there own).
> Questions to consider:
>  - Are there public domain document describing the format?
>  - Are the documents sufficient to engineer software to read data in the file format?
>  - How much effort would it be to engineer read software from scratch?

# Format should be migratable (as improved formats appear the significant properties of the files can be transferred to new formats).
> Questions to consider:
>  - Are there any format specific encodings that would be hard to move to other formats. (e.g. coloured cells in excel)

# Format is in use by the data centre user community
> Questions to consider:
>  - What is the designated user community for this feature type and use metadata?

# Conclusions
> Questions to consider:
>  - Should this be a recommended format for the archive:
>  - Should data in this format be rejected for the archive.
